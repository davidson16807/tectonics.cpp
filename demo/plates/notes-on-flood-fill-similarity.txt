We return true if fracture does not occur.
We start with the assumption that microfractures are sufficiently common 
such that plates are uniformly weak according to a single 
empirically derived value for stress (θ) beyond which fracture occurs.
So fracture does not occur if stress falls below θ.
Stress (forcer per unit area, F/A) is proportionate to virtual displacement (ΔL),
which can be calculated for two cells as follows:

A+U   L+ΔL  B+V
   ∘-------∘
  U ↖     ↗ V
     ∘---∘
    A  L  B

where A and B are velocities, U and V are velocities, and L is vertex distance

The specific equation that relates stress to virtual displacement is as follows: 

  F/A = E ΔL/L 

where E is young's modulus, which in this context can only be derived empirically.

`vertex_gradient` has magnitudes somewhere between 0 and 9000,
and we say that tangibly sized vectors (judging by our 3d render) are generally above 3000.
Fracture should absolutely occur between two tangible vectors of opposite sign,
but fracture should generally not occur between a tangible vector and a zero vector.
This places our displacement threshold somewhere around 6000<θ<9000 when L=1.
However grid radius is 2 and there are many vertices, given by `grid.vertices_per_meridian`.
By our calculations cell separation is typically 0.001 so θ must be 1000 times larger 
than the estimate above.

To allow the use of the existing floodfill algorithm, 
we further assume that neighboring cells are of constant distance apart 
and are offset by a vector that is aligned with the offset from the seed cell
to the current cell being considered at any iteration
