TODO:
* what happens to performance when using grids of a different class?
	dymaxion::Grid with cached coordinate bases
	dymaxion::Grid where x,y is determined by atan2 for a chaced coordinate basis
	collignon::Grid
	tectonics.py style fibonacci::Grid
	tectonics.js style icosahedron with massive octahedron grid for cached nearest_vertex_id lookups
* what happens to performance when LithosphereReferenceFrames operates on rasters of individual properties (e.g. density, thickness) and not `ColumnSummary`s as is done at present?
	probably need to use contents of ColumnSummaryProperties to first map individual `CrustSummary`s in LithosphereSummary to scalar rasters
