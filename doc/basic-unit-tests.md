Tectonics.cpp guarantees all core library functionality will go through at least a minimal set of unit tests, where appropriate.
This minimal set tests for the following physical, mathmatical, and computational properties. 
If a function is expected or required to have one of these properties, 
then a unit test must be written to demonstrate the function has that property for at least one circumstance.

determinism
nondeterminism
purity
regularity
idempotence
closure
identity
associativity
invertibility
commutativity
distributivity
increasing
decreasing
translational invariance
rotational invariance
resolution invariance
mass conservation
energy conservation
memory footprint constraints
miscellaneous equivalence relations
happy path (barring no other test)
