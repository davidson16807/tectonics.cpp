Tectonics.cpp guarantees all core library functionality will go through at least a minimal set of unit tests, where appropriate.
This minimal set tests for the following physical, mathmatical, and computational properties. 
If a function is expected or required to have one of these properties, 
then a unit test must be written to demonstrate the function has that property for at least one circumstance.

determinism
nondeterminism
purity
conceptual purity
regularity
closure
identity
associativity
invertibility
commutativity
distributivity
idempotence
involutivity
congruence
increasing
decreasing
adjoint
theorems for free
miscellaneous equivalence relations
limiting cases
degenerate cases
special cases
edge cases

transitivity
reflexivity
symmetry

precision requirements
memory footprint size requirements

translational invariance
rotational invariance
resolution invariance
mass conservation
energy conservation
reproducing real world values to within order of magnitude, factor of 2, 10%, etc.
