atmospheric approximation:
 * continuity makes a huge difference
 * accuracy of integration is secondary

noise functions in raymarch approximation:
 * continuity makes a huge difference
 * no need to integrate any particular function, can be chosen based on integrability

compounds library:
 * continuity makes no difference at all
 * accuracy of approximation is important
