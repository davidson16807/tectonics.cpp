IDEA: We want to minimize out-of-order memory access and maximize in-order memory access. This means if we have a process that requires combinations of both spatial transport (out-of-order memory access) and chemical reaction (in-order memory access) we should work at different grid resolutions, so that spatial transport is conducted using coarse resolution to minimize runtime, and chemical reaction is conducted using fine resolution to maximize quality of output. However conversion between grid resolutions is itself an out-of-order memory access issue.
