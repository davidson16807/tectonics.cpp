all light that reaches the camera comes from considering:
	emission
	reflection
	extinction
	attenuation
	scattering

things these shaders model:
	surface emission
	surface reflection
	gas emission
	gas scattering/attenuation
	camera point spread function

things these shaders do not distinguish:
	terrestrial vs gas giant
	gas giant vs brown dwarf vs star

RealisticSphereSwarmShaderProgram
	conditions:
		far enough away not too appreciate terrain
		close enough not to allow point source
	behavior: 
		raymarching done in fragment shader
	hot gasses:
		radius where temperature/density is inconsequential
		core temperature
	hot surfaces:
		surface temperature
		emmisivity (potentially assumed constant)
	gasses:
		betas for rayleigh/mie/absorption
		reference radius
		density at reference radius
		atmosphere scale height
	surfaces:
		main light source position
		main light source temperature
		main light source luminosity
		surface reflectivity
		surface roughness
		surface metallicity (?)
	radius
	position
