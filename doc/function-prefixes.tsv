`solve` 	function uses an iterative approximation and a significant performance penalty is to be expected
`approx` 	function uses an approximation that at least derives from a reputable published source
`fast`  	function uses an approximation for the purpose of performance, may or may not be published
`guess` 	function describes a model or approximation that is unpublished and either speculative or representative, typically due to a lack of better options
`get`   	function is strictly pure (i.e. not just "regular" or "conceptually pure", see `doc/GLOSSARY.md`)
