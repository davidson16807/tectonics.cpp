`grid/` contains classes that represent properties and relations for grids of certain type. A "grid" is defined as a series of nodes (called "vertices") connected by edges. Vertices are indexed in memory according to the methods of some `*Indexing` class, which represents a bijection `memory_idâ†”grid_id`. Vertices may also be represented in a space of some dimension, in which case there may be a `*Voronoi` class that represents a mapping between points in space and some id for the nearest vertex. Other classes may exist as need arises.
