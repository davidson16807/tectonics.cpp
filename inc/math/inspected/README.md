`inspected/` contrasts with `analytic/` in the sense that `analytic/` expresses things that can be known about a function based on how it is defined, whereas `inspected/` expresses things that can be known about a function based on how it behaves when called in different circumstances. `inspected` contains calculations for things like extrema, integrals, or derivatives, that can be done for any real continuous function. The downside to this generality is that these calculations are typically much slower.
