`branched` contains functions that aggregate over branches within a tree that is represented using a series.
branches are specified using a `parent_ids` series whose size is equal to the input series being aggregated and whose contents map the index of a node to the index of its parent. Nodes must always be ordered so that parent nodes appear after children, and the last index must represent the root node, whose parent id is itself. Each element in the output represents the value that is aggregated from all members of the branch that correspond to a node. This branch includes both the node and all its descendants.
