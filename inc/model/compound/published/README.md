Hi, and welcome to Crazy Eddie's Chemical Properties Emporium, where WE'VE GONE CRAZY!

This folder contains published properties of chemical compounds.
This is not a complete list of properties that are used within the model - 
 some properties cannot be found within published literature. When this occurs, 
 we must estimate a value for the property using rules defined within the "property" folder.
*Inferred values are never stored in this folder! This folder is meant only for published values!*

SOURCES (unless otherwise noted in comments):
* Where not mentioned otherwise, properties should be interpreted as being from 91st Handbook Of Chemistry And Physics. 
* Custom phase functions are taken from phase diagrams by Young (1975), "Phase Diagrams of the Elements", unless otherwise noted.
* Molecular absorption functions are taken from the MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest.
* Refraction index functions are taken from refractionindex.info.
* Reflectance functions are taken from version 7 of the USGS spectral library
* exponential and sigmoid functions for fluids at pressure and temperature were parameterized using data from NIST, https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/
* "Perry" functions for temperature were taken from the 9th edition of Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook
* "Dippr" functions for temperature are from the "DIPPR Data Compilation of Pure Chemical Properties", copied from the 9th edition of Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook
* "Prokhvatilov" functions for yield and fracture strength of cryogenic solids are taken from "Plasticity and Elasticity of Cryocrystals" by Prokhvatilov (2001)
* "Manzhelii" functions for thermal conductivity and specific heat of cryogenic solids are taken from "Physics of Cryocrystals" by Manzhelii & Freiman (1997)
* "Schön" properties for elastic moduli for minerals are taken from "Physical Properties of Rocks: Fundamentals and Principles of Petrophysics" by Juergen H. Schön (2015)

SIDE NOTE:
There are likely some among you who think this is excessive. That is all.
