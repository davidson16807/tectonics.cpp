approaches to modeling tectonic plate fracture:
* flood fills using interneighbor cosine similarity to test for inclusion, then populate unflooded regions with the vornoi diagram where seeds are midpoints of flooded regions
	+ flood fills model fracture by assuming that imperfections are sufficiently common so that, if anywhere fractures, it will be the place of greatest local stress
	+ voronoi requires only in-order traversal and can be done in reasonable time if number of plates is small
	- flood fill requires out-of-order traversal
* flood fills using interneighbor cosine similarity to test for inclusion, then dilate results
	+ flood fills model fracture by assuming that imperfections are sufficiently common so that, if anywhere fractures, it will be the place of greatest local stress
	- flood fill requires out-of-order traversal
	- dilation requires out-of-order traversal
* repeated filters for cosine similarity with seed vector using increasingly broad searches
	+ filters require only in-order traversal
	- comparison with seed vector imposes a limit to the size of plates even when stress is everywhere negligible
* gradient descent using in-order traversals to find seeds that minimize cosine similarity between the seed and the vertices for whom the seed is closest
	- comparison with seed vector imposes a limit to the size of plates even when stress is everywhere negligible
* gradient descent using in-order traversals to find seeds that minimize energy between all vertices 
	+ intractably slow, since even a single iteration requires out-of-order traversal, and many traversals are required
