we use the conceptual model from Schellart 2010 to calculate plate velocity
see research/lithosphere/schellart2010.pdf and research/lithosphere/schellart2010-supplement.pdf 
Here's an intuitive explanation:
Imagine a foam mat floating in a swimming pool. 
One side of the foam mat has lead weights strapped to it. 
It's just barely enough to sink the mat. 
The foam mat slides across the surface and into the water. 
        
 ________ →     
 ~~~~~~~~\~~~~~~~~~
        ↓| 
         ° ← lead weight  

Since the foam mat doesn't stretch, we know it must slide across the surface at the same rate it sinks. 
The rate at which it sinks is a constant, known as the terminal velocity.
This is the speed at which the drag force of the water counteracts the buoyant force of the lead weights.

 ________
 ~~~~~~~~\~~~~~~~~~
         |↓ buoyant force
         °↑ drag force

Replace the foam mat with a tectonic plate and you'll start to see how the model handles plate velocity.
There is a buoyancy force (b) that causes slabs to subduct.
The slabs generate a drag force (d) as they pass through the mantle.
The two forces reach an equilibrium where the velocity (v) of a region does not change. 
Since these forces are only noticeable over millions of years, 
by the time we notice their effect they should have already equilibrated. 
So we can't just simulate the forces over multiple timesteps. 
The forces involved could also vary greatly from planet to planet,
so we wouldn't even know what timesteps to use even if we want to use that approach.
So how about this, instead:
For there to be equilibrium, the sum of the forces must be zero. 
Since plates are assumed to be rigid bodies, 
we must consider the forces acting across the entire plate.
So ∫ b + d(v) dΩ = 0 where Ω is the area of a plate. 
Since b does not vary based on v, we simplify this to:
B + ∫ d(v) dΩ = 0 where B = ∫ b dΩ is the sum of buoyancy forces.

We start by making some sort of appropriate guess for the velocity of the rigid body plate.

D = ∫ d(v) ∂Ω
the derivative ∂D/∂v therefore is:
D = ∫ ∂d/∂v ∂Ω
Schellart makes a statement of a similar nature.
We make several local estimates for velocity and then 
make an estimate for the entire rigid body using the local estimates. 
We then calculate the local drag forces that would result at that velocity.
We take the difference between local drag forces and local buoyant forces.
Let's call these "local net forces".
The local net forces ought to sum to zero, but they probably will not,
either because they cancel out when we calculate the velocity for the rigid body
or there is a flaw in our inital guess, or any number of other reasons.

let's consider a concrete example
There's a plate shaped like a rectangle. One side is subducting, 
which causes the plate to rotate.
We calculate velocity given local buoyant forces then find an angular velocity based upon them.
The region furthest from the axis now subducts faster than it would in isolation.
This causes a greater drag force than was predicted 

dv/dt = F/m

If the drag forces don't sum up to match the buoyancy forces, we know we got the velocity wrong.
But since velocity is a linear function of force, 
We can map the net forces back into a correction .
We can do this any number of times for added precision.

Remember: v is not a constant. If a rigid body rotates, 
the points that are furthest from the axis have higher velocity.
We need to find the translation T and rotation R for the whole object such that 
the local velocities v meet the requirement ∫ b + d(v) dΩ = 0 
v = T x r_world + R x r_plate
We 

compare this to our previous method, which was to find v for each point based on b and take the average
We start with the assumption b = -ζv 
then v = - 1/Ω ∫ b/ζ dΩ
then v = - 1/(Ωζ) B
then ζvΩ = -B 
then -ζv = d(v) because -B = ∫ d(v) dΩ

We use that guess to calculate 

Schellart uses the following equation to describe the terminal velocity of a plate:
 

     v = S F (WLT)^2/3 /18 cμ
where v is velocity, F is force, and the rest of the parameters are used as follows:

WARNING:
most of this is wrong! Here, we try calculating terminal velocity for each grid cell in isolation,
then try to average them to approximate the velocity of the rigid body. 

If we wanted to do it the correct way, this is how we'd do it:
* find drag force, subtract it from slab pull force, and use that to update velocity via netwonian integration
* repeat simulation for several iterations every time step 
the reason we don't do it the correct way is 1.) it's slow, 2.) it's complicated, and 3.) it's not super important
