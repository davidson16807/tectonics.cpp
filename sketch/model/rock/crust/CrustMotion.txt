Se use the conceptual model from Schellart (2010) to calculate plate velocity.

Here's an intuitive explanation:
Imagine a foam mat floating in a swimming pool. 
One side of the foam mat has lead weights strapped to it. 
It's just barely enough to sink the mat. 
The foam mat slides across the surface and into the water. 
        
 ________ →     
 ~~~~~~~~\~~~~~~~~~
        ↓| 
         ° ← lead weight  

Though Schellart (2010)'s assumptions differ from ours,
we are content to say for our model that the foam mat slides across the surface at the same rate it sinks. 
This would naturally occur if the foam mat does not stretch and is too buoyant to founder by itself.
The rate at which it sinks is a constant, known as the terminal velocity.
This is the speed at which the drag force of the water counteracts the buoyant force of the lead weights.

 ~~~~~~~~\~~~~~~~~~
         |↓ buoyant force
         °↑ drag force

Replace the foam mat with a tectonic plate and 
you'll start to see how the model handles plate velocity.
There is a net buoyancy force (b) that causes slabs to subduct.
The slabs generate a drag force (d) as they pass through the mantle.
The drag force is a function of velocity, and the buoyant force is invariant to it.
The two forces reach an equilibrium where the velocity (v) of a region does not change. 
Since these forces are only noticeable over millions of years, 
by the time we notice their effect they should have already equilibrated. 
So we can't just simulate the forces over multiple timesteps. 
The forces involved could also vary greatly from planet to planet,
so we wouldn't even know what timesteps to use even if we want to use that approach.

So how about this, instead:
For there to be equilibrium, the sum of the forces must be zero. 
Since plates are assumed to be rigid bodies, 
we must consider the forces acting across the entire plate.
So ∫ b + d(v) dΩ = 0 where dΩ is the area of an infinitesimal localized subducting region. 
We can also denote this as B + ∫ d(v) dΩ = 0 where B = ∫ b dΩ is the sum of net buoyancy forces.

Now we have to specify what b and d are, exactly.
The net buoyancy force, b, is simply the sum of buoyancy and gravity.
The force of gravity is mg, where m is mass and g is gravitational acceleration.
For reasons that will become clear it is easier to think in terms of densities and volumes,
so we rephrase this as -mg = -ϱVg where ϱ is crust density and V is the volume of the solid. 
By Archimedes principle, buoyancy force is equivalent to the weight of displaced liquid,
so buoyancy force is ρVg where ρ is mantle density. 
Therefore the net buoyancy force is 

b = ρVg-ϱVg 
  = (ρ-ϱ)Vg 
  = ΔρVg where Δρ=ρ-ϱ.

The drag force, d, will vary by problem. 
We will start by discussing the drag equation for a sphere 
of a certain diameter, D, or radius, R=D/2,
and then adapt that equation to work with subducting slabs.

If the effect of inertia is significant, 
then the equation for drag is the same that is used in aviation, 
or ρv²CA/V for a given cross-sectional area, A, and drag coefficient, C.
However the dynamic viscosity of the mantle, μ, is very high 
compared to the diameter and velocity that we are working with,
so the effect of inertia is negligible.
This is indicated by a very low Reynolds number, Re=ρvD/μ.
In such circumstances the drag coefficient is inversely proportionate to velocity,
so drag becomes linear to velocity. 
Stokes (1851) was first person to work out the drag for such circumstances.
In the case of a sphere, drag becomes d = 6πμRv = 3πμDv. 
Since the volume of a sphere is V = 4πR³/3 = πD³/6, the buoyancy is b=ΔρgπD³/6. 
Buoyancy and drag are equal, so:

   b     =   d
ΔρgπD³/6 = 3πμDv

so we can solve for v, which is the terminal velocity of a sphere through the mantle.

ΔρgπD²
⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ = v
 18πμ

Schellart (2010) makes the assumption that slabs can be approximated as ellipsoids. 
Oberbeck (1876) worked out the equations for this circumstance,
but his work is in German and I haven't figured out if he explicitly states the drag force.
However Kerr (1991) provides the terminal velocity for ellipsoids, 
which is simply the equation for a sphere of equivalent diameter, such that D³=LTW
except scaled by a shape factor, S:

SΔρgπ(LTW)²𝄍³
⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ = v
    18πμ

where "W" is the width of the slab running along the subduction zone,
"T" is thickness, and "L" is the length of the subducted region, 
which Schellart (2010) sets at a constant L=1000km.
"S" is given by Kerr (1991) for settling parallel to L:

       ⌠∞  2L²+λ            D
S = ³/₈⎮  ⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ ⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ dλ
       ⌡0   L²+λ  √((L²+λ)(T²+λ)(W²+λ))

We note that if we adopt a different factor:

    S      ⌠∞  2a²+λ            1
ς = ⎻ = ³/₈⎮  ⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ ⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ dλ
    D      ⌡0   a²+λ   √(a²+λ)(b²+λ)(c²+λ)

then the equation for terminal velocity simplifies to:

ςΔρgπLTW
⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ = v
  18πμ

We now know the terminal velocity for ellipsoids, 
and we can figure out the net buoyancy for ellipsoids,
so we can use this information to reconstruct the drag force.
Net buoyancy for ellipsoids is:

b = ΔρgV where V=4πLTW/3
  = 4πΔρgLTW/3

We know that 

ςΔρgπLTW
⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ = v
  18πμ

and therefore

ςΔρgπLTW
⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ = 1
  18πμv

We also know that b=d and therefore 1=b/d, so:

ςΔρgπLTW   b
⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ = ⎻ = 1
  18πμv    d

invert and multiply all sides by b:

 18πμvb
⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ = d = b
ςΔρgπLTW

sustitute b and simplify:

24μvπ/ς = d

At this point, it would be useful if we could assume that for all local regions of subduction, 
the flow around that local region can be approximated as the flow around a local ellipsoid.
If this were the case, then forces for the slab could be modeled as the sum of ellipsoid slab segments, one per cell.
Buoyancy is obviously linear to W, and given that L and T do not vary significantly throughout a slab,
the validity of this assumption relies on the extent to which d is linear to W.
We see that ςd is constant for any W, so for this assumption to be valid,
ς must not appreciably scale with W for the region of interest.
ς does saturate for sufficiently large W/L (https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cibmmztres)
so local forces could be calculated as ellipsoid segments,
but only so long as those segments are much wider than their the nominal 1000km length,
and even the coarsest resolutions are expected to have cells of width that fall below this threshold.

For the sake of discussion, we will discuss drag force d 
as being equally distributed among N discrete slab segments.
We note that drag force for ellipsoids scales linear to velocity,
so we estimate drag force for some reference velocity u,
then use that estimate to calculate each slab segment's contribution to drag for the reference velocity,
then scale each segment's contribution to their local velocity v.
So for a given cell with velocity v in a plate whose subducted region(s) 
are composed of N cells of some necessary equal characteristic, 
that cell's contribution to drag force is

       vd(u)   24μvπ
δ(v) = ⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻ = ⎻⎻⎻⎻⎻
        uN      ςN

where d(u) is the drag for an ellipsoid whose dimensions equal the slab when straighted out,
and whose velocity u is any reference value.
If Δ is defined as Δ=∫δ(v)dΩ for a flat 2d region, 
then Δ=d(v) in the degenerate case where the slab is straight and traveling at a uniform velocity.
In all other cases, serviceability requires the assumption that 
local flow will not vary significantly for any amount of bending or interruption that can be expected of a slab. 
Schellart (2010) at least suggests some serviceability,
since he shows that even a simplified ellipsoid can predict the speeds 
of real world plate having complex geometry with R values at or near 0.7.

Previously, we wrote equations for b and d for a 1-dimensional vertical case.
We now need to adapt these equations to consider the sphere. 
Since the plate is a rigid body that is confined to the surface of a sphere, 
the total bouyancy and drag force acting on the plate 
will be completely described by a magnitude and euler pole.
Confinement to a sphere means that the usual equations regarding torque apply.

Since horizontal force is assumed equal to vertical force,
the buoyancy force that is imparted in the vertical case 
will equal the magnitude of a horizontal force in the direction of the boundary normal, n̂.
Given that r̂ is the normalized position of a segment relative to the center of the world,
the total buoyancy torque acting on the plate is:

     B = ∫ r⃗×bn̂ dΩ.

The total drag torque acting on the plate, D, 
need not have any association with the boundary normal, n̂.
Since plates are assumed to be rigid bodies on a sphere,
the motion v⃗ at each point is entirely determined by a rotation vector for the entire plate, ω⃗.
More precisely, we say that everywhere horizontal velocity is v⃗=ω⃗×r⃗, or ω⃗=r⃗×v⃗/r⃗².
Since vertical velocity of a subducting slab is assumed equal in magnitude to horizontal velocity,
the velocity of our 1-dimensional drag estimate is v=|ω||r|.
Drag occurs in the same direction as the velocity, 
and since vertical forces are assumed equal in magnitude to horizontal forces,
the horizontal drag force is d=24πμv⃗/ςN. 
Therefore the direction of horizontal velocity need not be n̂, 
it is whatever v⃗ permits an ω⃗ such that D(ω⃗)=B.
If we write the drag force vector as d⃗=дv⃗/N where д=24πμ/ς, 
then the total drag torque is:

     D = ∫ r⃗×d⃗ dΩ
     D = ∫ r⃗×д/Nv⃗ dΩ

if we discretize to consider the same N slab segments as before then:

     D = Σᴺ r⃗×д/Nv⃗
       = Σᴺ д/N(r⃗×v⃗)
       = Σᴺ д/N(r⃗×(ω×r⃗))
       = д/N Σᴺ(r⃗×v⃗)
       = д/N Σᴺω⃗r²
       = д Nω⃗r²/N
       = дω⃗r²

where r is the radius of the earth

The rotation vector ω⃗ is the only unknown here.
It will assume whatever value is necessary for D(ω⃗)=B. 

If we consider the equation for D, we see that it is composed of magnitudes and directions:

     D = |дr²| |ω| ω̂

where ω⃗=|ω| ω̂, and |дr²|=дr² since in all cases дr² ≥ 0.

B is also composed of a direction and magnitude:

     B = |B| B̂

and since D=B:

     D = |дr²| |ω| ω̂ = |B| B̂

the only way this could be true dimensionally is if:

     ω̂ = B̂

and:

     дr² |ω| = |B|
         |ω| = |B|/дr² 

Therefore we know ω⃗=ω̂ |ω|, which is all that is needed to proceed with simulation.

     ω̂ |ω| = B̂|B|/дr² 

     ω⃗ = B//дr²
       = 1//дr² ∫ r⃗×bn̂ dΩ
       = ς/24πμr² ∫ ΔρgVr⃗×n̂ dΩ
