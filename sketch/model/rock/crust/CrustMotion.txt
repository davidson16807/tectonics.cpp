we use the conceptual model from Schellart 2010 to calculate plate velocity
see research/lithosphere/schellart2010.pdf and research/lithosphere/schellart2010-supplement.pdf 
Here's an intuitive explanation:
Imagine a foam mat floating in a swimming pool. 
One side of the foam mat has lead weights strapped to it. 
It's just barely enough to sink the mat. 
The foam mat slides across the surface and into the water. 
        
 ________ →     
 ~~~~~~~~\~~~~~~~~~
        ↓| 
         ° ← lead weight  

Since the foam mat doesn't stretch, we know it must slide across the surface at the same rate it sinks. 
The rate at which it sinks is a constant, known as the terminal velocity.
This is the speed at which the drag force of the water counteracts the buoyant force of the lead weights.

 ________
 ~~~~~~~~\~~~~~~~~~
         |↓ buoyant force
         °↑ drag force

Replace the foam mat with a tectonic plate and you'll start to see how the model handles plate velocity.
There is a buoyancy force (b) that causes slabs to subduct.
The slabs generate a drag force (d) as they pass through the mantle.
The two forces reach an equilibrium where the velocity (v) of a region does not change. 
Since these forces are only noticeable over millions of years, 
by the time we notice their effect they should have already equilibrated. 
So we can't just simulate the forces over multiple timesteps. 
The forces involved could also vary greatly from planet to planet,
so we wouldn't even know what timesteps to use even if we want to use that approach.
So how about this, instead:
For there to be equilibrium, the sum of the forces must be zero. 
Since plates are assumed to be rigid bodies, 
we must consider the forces acting across the entire plate.
So ∫ b + d(v) dΩ = 0 where Ω is the area of a plate. 
Since b does not vary based on v, we simplify this to
B + ∫ d(v) dΩ = 0 where B = ∫ b dΩ is the sum of buoyancy forces.
Another way to phrase this is that ∫d(v)dΩ = -B,
so that drag forces must sum to a constant.
Also since plates are assumed to be rigid bodies,
the motion d(v) at each point is completely determined by a rotation vector ω,
so the integral D=∫d(v)dΩ is completely determined by ω,
and since we are trying to determine the ω that minimizes the distance between D and B,
we can construct a distance metric such as (D(ω)-B)²,
and then perform gradient descent using ∇(D(ω)-B)². 
We can start descent from any naïve assumption, 
such as to say that ω is proportionate to the rotation vector for B.
∇(D(ω)-B)² can be calculated using an in-order traversal of memory
without need to store large rasters of output,
so the performance of the gradient descent is inconsequential 
when compared to other calculations in the model.

Schellart uses the following equation to describe the terminal velocity of a plate:

     v = S F (WLT)^2/3 /18 cμ

where v is velocity, F is force, and the rest of the parameters are used as follows: …

TODO: modify to linearize the width parameter ("W") 
originally: 
     v = S F (WLT)^2/3 /18 cμ
modify to:
     v = S F W(LT)^1/2 /18 cμ

TODO: REMOVE HARDCODED CONSTANTS!
TODO: make width dependant on the size of subducting region!
