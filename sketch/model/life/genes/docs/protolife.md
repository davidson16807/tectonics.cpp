how to create life in just N easy steps (best guess):
* create threo-purines by heat cycling purine in the presence of random organic compounds
* create oligomers of glyoxylate threo-purines ("GThPA" for the sake of brevity)
* create GThPA cross-chiral self-polymerase, using tertiary structure for bonding
* create groups of GThPA that assemble into a "GThPA polymerase threozyme" that is able to copy individual components
* create groups of GThPA that assemble into a  "GThPA polymerase threozyme" that converts GThPA to RThPA, hopefully compatible with
