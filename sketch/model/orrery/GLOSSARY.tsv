	
node	a node within a scene tree, determined completely by a coordinate system that's expressed relative to the coordinate system of a parent node
entity	an entity within an implementation of the entity-component-system (ECS) design pattern
component	a component within an implementation of the entity-component-system (ECS) design pattern
orientation	a position and rotation, effectively a coordinate system
motion	any change to a node's orientation, represented as a component
track	a motion defined as a function returning positions or rotations for a given time
body	an entity that's associated with a mass, it typically has a position track and a rotation track
cycle	a motion that repeats after a set time
cyclical	being a cycle
period	the amount of time at which a cycle repeats
beeline	a position track where a body travels in a straight line
orbit	a cyclical position track where a body travels according to gravity in a 2-body problem
spin	a cyclical rotation track, including nutation and precession
lock	a spin defined such that a direction is defined in local coordinates so as to always point towards a body in global coordinates, possibly confined to an axis
perceptible	having an effect that can be perceived by the user, either due to a cycle whose period is longer than several frames or a motion that can be perceived after the user returns from sleep or work
imperceptible	not perceptible
resonance	a set of cycles whose periods are approximated as whole number fractions of each other, forming a larger cycle
resonant	being a part of a resonance
ergodic	occurring on timescales such that all states that can be assumed to occur will occur in a single timestep, considered in the model as occurring for any imperceptible nonresonant motion
