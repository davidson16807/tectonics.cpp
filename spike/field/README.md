"field" contains classes of callable objects with closed form overloads of `operator()` with the form ℝ²→𝕋 and ℝ³→𝕋 for some arbitrary type 𝕋.
It is meant to represent the concept of a "field" in the context of physics, which continuously maps each point in a space with a value. 

"field" uses `glm` as a requirement for all functionality.
