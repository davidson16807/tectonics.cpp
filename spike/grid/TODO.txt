prototype?
	production?
		mitigations:
x	x		ignoring irregular arrows
x	x		regularizing irregular vertices
		methods:
			curvilinear method
			weighted linear
		polyhedron:
			pentakis dodecahedron
			fibonacci grid
		projections:
x	x		gnomonic (already effectively done, but required work to realize this)
x			healpix equal-area
			snyder equal-area
		other:
x	x		move vector calculus to classes (necessary to attempt alternate methods)
			collignon with regularized vertices (easy, more out of curiosity)
