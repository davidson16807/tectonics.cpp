A `Stratum` is a subsection of a plate that is characterized by a unique manner of formation and position on the globe.
It consists of several `Mineral` mass pools that each track the mass, weathering, and grain distribution for a solid of a given chemical compound and phase.

The number of strata varies in principle, and the number that can we can afford to represent is very low,
so we only represent strata if it serves some functional distinction.
These functional distinctions include a "bedrock" layer that is only created upon the rifting of plates,
a "sediment" layer that may accumulate during weathering and sediment transport,
and a "sedimentary" layer that accumulates during lithification.
Each of these three layers may be diminished by weathering, 
the sediment layer is diminished by lithification,
and the bedrock and sedimentary layers are subject to metamorphosis,
however all layers may contain weathered and unweathered material,
and all layers may contain metamorphosed and unmetamorphosed material,
since weathering and metamorphosis have effects upon rock 
that persist across sediment transport and lithification.
