The original molecular components of proto-
RNA may have been different from, but
still similar to, those found in RNA

The covalent bonds that connected the three
molecular components of proto-RNA were
( periodically) reversible

A wide range of biological
bond-forming reactions involve the loss of
water, including amide linkages in pep-
tides, acetal linkages in polysaccharides
and ester linkages in phosphoglycerols. Per-
tinent to the present discussion are the
reactions required for nucleic acid forma-
tion—glycosylation of a nucleobase to
form a nucleoside, phosphorylation of a
nucleoside to form a nucleotide and con-
densation of nucleotides to form oligonu-
cleotides—all of which are dehydration
reactions.

Why would the nucleobases have been selected
for inclusion in RNA or proto-RNA polymers for
the purpose of Watson-Crick base pairing if they
did not form base pairs before being linked by a
common backbone?

If we restrict our consideration of potential
proto-RNA base pairs to those with a Watson-
Crick pairing geometry, there are still twelve
possible types of nucleobases that can form six
types of base pairs with distinct hydrogen
bond donor– acceptor arrangements

Nomenclature: pu, a [6,5] fused ring system; py, a six-membered ring. The hydrogen-bonding pattern
of acceptor (A) and donor (D) groups from the major to the minor groove is indicated. For example, the standard nucleobase cytosine is pyDAA.

The abiotic formation of proto-RNA containing only pu-
rine bases is appealing for several reasons. First,
an all purine system requires only one type of
heterocycle, and the variety of conditions under
which purine production has been shown sug-
gests that purines may be formed more easily
in model prebiotic reactions than pyrimidines
(Oro 1961; Sanchez et al. 1966; Saladino et al.
2004). Second, nucleoside formation, as dis-
cussed later, might have occured more effi-
ciently with purine bases. Third, the purine
bases have much more favorable stacking inter-
actions in aqueous solution than the pyrimi-
dine bases (Ts’o, Melvin et al. 1963; Inoue and
Orgel 1983).

The optimal functionality of ribose suggests
that its inclusion in RNA is more the result of
evolutionary refinement than prebiotic avail-
ability.

The four carbon sugar threose is of particu-
lar interest as a potential ancestor of ribose
Experiments with 3 0 ,2 0 -linked threofuranose
nucleic acid, or TNA, have generated significant
excitement in the origin of life community. In
addition to the potential relative ease of forma-
tion of threose in a prebiotic environment,
duplexes of TNA oligonucleotides are of com-
parable stability to RNA and DNA duplexes,
and TNA forms hybrid duplexes with RNA
and DNA

A backbone containing even fewer atoms,
but of the same polymer repeat length as TNA,
has been termed GNA
GNA oligonucleotides
with Watson-Crick complementary sequences
form antiparallel duplexes that are even more
stable than DNA or RNA duplexes of the same
nucleobase sequence (Zhang and Meggers
2005). In contrast, little or no hybridization is
observed between complementary GNA and
DNA oligonucleotides

Simply heating forma-
mide in the presence of various mineral cata-
lysts, as performed with a great variety of
minerals by the Saladino and DiMauro labora-
tories (Saladino et al. 2007), have produced all
four canonical RNA bases, as well as purine
acyclonucleosides (albeit with rudimentary
“sugar” moieties) (Saladino et al. 2003)
