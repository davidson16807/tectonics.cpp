A "segment" is a pattern within a body that repeats along a given axis.
Examples can be seen in the outer layers of earth worms and millipedes,
but also less visibly in the exoskeletons of insects and the endoskeletons of vertebrates.
They are used in virtually every complex bilateral animal.
Each segment within a body may have its own unique attributes, defined on a per-segment basis. 
A segment can be formed by a chemical reaction/diffusion system causing a standing wave pattern.
The number of segments within a body is controlled by "realizator genes".
And specialization for individual segments can be disabled by "homeotic genes".
If a segment's specialization is disabled, the segment still exists, 
but the segment takes on the form of the segment that occurred before it, closer to the head.

This model stores a constant number of segments in memory for an organism.
This is done to allow organisms to be stored on the stack. 
However animals may control the number of segments that are expressed along an axis,
they may shrink the physical length of a segment down to where its effectively nonexistant,
and they may disable specialization for a particular segment.
